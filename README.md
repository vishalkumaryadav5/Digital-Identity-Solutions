## Project Description

Digital Identity Solutions is a blockchain-based smart contract system that enables secure, decentralized management of digital identities. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, this project provides a trustless platform for users to create, verify, and manage their digital identities while maintaining full control over their personal information.

The system eliminates the need for centralized identity providers by leveraging blockchain technology to create immutable, verifiable digital identities. Users can register their identities, get verified by authorized entities, and add credentials to build a comprehensive digital profile that can be trusted across various platforms and services.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a world where individuals have complete sovereignty over their digital identities. We aim to eliminate the risks associated with centralized identity systems, such as data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to personal information. By providing a decentralized, secure, and user-controlled identity management system, we empower users to interact in the digital world with confidence and privacy.

We envision a future where Digital Identity Solutions becomes the foundation for secure online interactions, enabling seamless verification processes across various industries including finance, healthcare, education, and e-commerce, while ensuring that users maintain full ownership and control of their personal data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Truffle or Hardhat framework
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Ganache for local blockchain testing

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Compile contracts: `truffle compile` or `npx hardhat compile`
4. Deploy to local network: `truffle migrate` or `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`
5. Run tests: `truffle test` or `npx hardhat test`

### Usage
1. Deploy the contract to your preferred network
2. Use the contract owner account to authorize verifiers
3. Users can create identities using `createIdentity()`
4. Verifiers can validate identities using `verifyIdentity()`
5. Verified users can add credentials using `addCredential()`

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions
- `createIdentity(string name, string email)` - Create a new digital identity
- `verifyIdentity(address userAddress)` - Verify a user's identity (verifiers only)
- `addCredential(string credential)` - Add credentials to verified identity

### Utility Functions
- `getIdentity(address userAddress)` - Retrieve identity information
- `getCredentials(address userAddress)` - Get user's credentials
- `authorizeVerifier(address verifier)` - Authorize new verifiers (owner only)
